/**
we have a smart contract called MyToken that allows users to swap tokens and stake tokens for a specific lock period.

The swap function allows users to swap their tokens for the smart contract's tokens. The user's token balance is increased by the amount swapped.

The stake function allows users to stake their tokens for a specific lock period. The user's token balance is decreased by the amount staked, and a new Staking object is created with the staking details.

The unlockStake function allows users to unlock their stake after the lock period is over. The user's balance is increased by the staked amount, and the isUnlocked flag is set to true.

The withdraw function allows users to withdraw their tokens from the smart contract. The user's token balance is set to zero, and the tokens are transferred to the user's address.

Note that this is a simple example, and more complex dApp applications may require more complex swap and staking functions. It is essential to have a thorough understanding of Solidity and smart contract development best practices to ensure that your dApp is secure and functions as intended.
